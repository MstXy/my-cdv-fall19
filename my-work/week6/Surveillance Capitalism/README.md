## "Surveillance Capitalism"
###        —— Shoshana Zuboff's talk on The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism

#### What does Zuboff mean by "Surveillance Capitalism":

The surveillance capitalism is the commodification of people’s private human experience, i.e. their behavioral data. The companies collect those behavioral data, analyze them to predict user’s future behavior and could offer online targeted advertisement, or could use them to improve the companies’ services. The thing is, the improvement made on services is not for the benefit of users, but for the aim that they could gain more precise and detailed behavioral data from their users in order to gain more profit from the surveillance data.

#### Is there aspects of Zuboff's ideas that...
#####    ...you were partilcuarly surprise by?
#####   ...disagree with?
#####    ...spark associations with your own experience?
#####    ...you want to ask further questions about?

Zuboff mentions the sentence: “If you have nothing to hide, there is nothing to worry about.” She counterargues that by saying: “If you have nothing to hide, you are degraded to nothing.” I actually didn’t agree to that since I searched about this sentence in the first class of our course and I feel myself fully buying it, until she puts out more explanation. Zuboff argues that our sense of identity, voice, autonomy, critical thinking, moral judgement and the ability to resist could be undermined by the surveillance – the collected data could be used to figure out ways to influence and modify the society’s behavior. As she has said in the latter part of the video, though surveillance capitalism aims for the commercial outcomes initially, it could actually be used to produce political and social outcomes. I have asserted before watching this video that as long as these collected data is not used against us, I am not opposed to the surveillance. However, right now I am vacillating. Zuboff says that those “unprecedented” is almost impossible to recognize, and I believe I am not able to know if they are used against me or not – I am the indigenous people, and the companies are those people talking Castilian Spanish while making incursion to rob my individual sovereignty.
One interesting idea Zuboff puts is that the forth estate – the press is on the contrary of surveillance capitalism, it’s a totally new idea to me and it makes sense: the press is on the same side of democracy. If the press could pressures the surveillance be transparent, and publicize the misbehavior of those companies and make those their public relationship nightmare, maybe the issue could be mitigated.
However, I do doubt whether democracy is the solution. As there is not full academic freedom (there are political and social restrictions), there would not be full democracy, since different interest groups will always exist and economic logic is always embedded in the society.
