## My First Exercise in Critical Data & Visualization
The exercise really takes some time to finish. I think it is quite useful for me to pick up the knowledge last semester in Communications Lab. I also learned some new features which were never used in my previous projects, such as <form> and <input>.

One thing I am not sure about is that whether I should clear all these squares each time the **create square** button is clicked. And I am still figuring out how to realize it.
