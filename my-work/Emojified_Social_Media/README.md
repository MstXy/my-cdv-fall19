# Emojified-Social-Media  
Spring 2020 Critical Data &amp; Visualization Final Project  

### Project Name: Emojified Social Media  
#### Project Link: https://mstxy.github.io/Emojified-Social-Media/

#### Description  
&emsp;The project is based on a raw dataset of 18 million unprocessed English tweets with at least one emojis, as well as a file about the how these emojis are used in Twitter: how many are used in positive, neutral and negative tweets.  

&emsp;For the analyze of the data, I calculated the sentiment score for each emoji â€“ if it is used more in negative tweets, then it is more negative than positive. Then, using Python's VADER and NLTK library, I get the text sentiment for each tweet. Other than that, I processed the data to get the average Position of each emoji, Combinations of emojis in each text, the number of times one emoji is Spammed in each text.  

&emsp;Therefore, for the project, it is a visualization of my result of the research mainly using d3.js library. It includes five different interactive graphs, each represents one aspect of my result.  

&emsp;Hope you enjoy it!
