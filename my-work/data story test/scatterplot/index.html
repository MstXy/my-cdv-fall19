      <p class="mainContent" id="intro">Emoji, developed from the 1990s, has become a complete and well-supported system today. We use emoji, sometimes to support our texts and express emotions, and sometimes, we spam emoji just to show the strong feeling within us. Emoji are so widely used, but <b>do we understand emoji enough?</b></p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro2">Emoji are often misunderstood. This misunderstanding relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji – when the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro3">🙂 → 😑</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro4">[A smiley face could be sent to convey <br>a despising, mocking, even obnoxious attitude.]</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro5">Researchers found that 40 percent of emoji tested had a “sentiment misconstrual score” of 2 or more, so when two people look at the same emoji, the sentiment disagreement between them would be much greater than that. <b>Now the question comes,</b> are you sure the emoji sent by you means exactly the same in the recipient's mind? Or are you certain how you perceive one emoji is what the majority does?</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro6">So, the data I found is a raw data set of 18 million unprocessed English tweets with at least one emojis, as well as a file about the how these emojis are used in Twitter: how many are used in positive, neutral and negative tweets, and base on that, I could calculate the sentiment score for each emoji – if it is used more in negative tweets, then it is more negative than positive.</p>
