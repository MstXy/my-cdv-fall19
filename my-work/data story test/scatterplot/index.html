      <p class="mainContent" id="intro">Emoji, developed from the 1990s, has become a complete and well-supported system today. We use emoji, sometimes to support our texts and express emotions, and sometimes, we spam emoji just to show the strong feeling within us. Emoji are so widely used, but <b>do we understand emoji enough?</b></p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro2">Emoji are often misunderstood. This misunderstanding relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji – when the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro3">🙂 → 😑</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro4">[A smiley face could be sent to convey <br>a despising, mocking, even obnoxious attitude.]</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro5">Researchers found that 40 percent of emoji tested had a “sentiment misconstrual score” of 2 or more, so when two people look at the same emoji, the sentiment disagreement between them would be much greater than that. <b>Now the question comes,</b> are you sure the emoji sent by you means exactly the same in the recipient's mind? Or are you certain how you perceive one emoji is what the majority does?</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro6">So, the data I found is a raw data set of <span class="highlightedNumber">18 million</span> unprocessed English tweets with at least one emojis, as well as a file about the how these emojis are used in Twitter: how many are used in positive, neutral and negative tweets, and base on that, I could calculate the sentiment score for each emoji – if it is used more in negative tweets, then it is more negative than positive.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="intro7">Let's see what the data tells us ——</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph11"><b>Neutrality</b> - Neutral Occurrences ÷ Total Occurrences</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph12"><b>Sentiment Score</b> - (Positive Occurrences - Negative Occurrences) ÷ Total Occurrences</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph13">• The higher the emoji, the more neutral.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph14">• Emojis on the right are more positive.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph15">• The size shows the relative occurrences.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph16">More emojis are clustering on <span class="interactiveBtn" id="clickToZoomIn1">the right hand side</span>, which shows there are more positive emojis (of course!), or to say, there are more positive tweets sent out each day.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph1instruction1">[Please Double-click on the graph to zoom out.]</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="graph17">The emojis with more occurrences are all gathering in <span class="interactiveBtn" id="clickToZoomIn2">the lower middle part</span>, it seems the most popular emojis are all used for expressing emotions.</p>

      <p class="mainContent" id="textSenti2">Critics of emoji have expressed that: <br>As we outsource our feelings to tiny pictures, it narrows our ability to express ourselves honestly. <br>When we use emojis, we’re not revealing our emotions—we’re often stifling them.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="textSenti3">So, Are we <b>feeling less of the feels</b>, while <b>becoming more emotional on the social media?</b></p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="textSenti4"><i>"In fact, we don’t even <b>have</b> emotions—we have feels. But maybe not all the feels."</i></p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="textSenti5">I used the Natural Language Token and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) library of Python to give the text sentiment scores separately from emojis and see how emoji is contributing to the emotion of the tweets.</p>
      <p class="mainContent" id="textSenti6">I bet the graph is a bit <i>unexpected</i>? From the <b>positive</b> graph, it seems in most times, our emotion in our text conform with the emojis' emotion. <br>However, from the <b>negative</b> graph, most emojis' sentiment score are positive? <br>That opens a new topic beyond my reach, but we may guess that when we are expressing negative emotions, we tend to use positive emojis to cover it up? </p>
